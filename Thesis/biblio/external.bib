@article{Keilhacker1999,
   abstract = {During the second half of 1997, JET carried out a broad-based series of D-T experiments (DTE1) producing a total of 675MJ of fusion energy. A large scale tritium supply and processing plant, the first of its kind, allowed the repeated use of the 20 g tritium on site, supplying a total of 99.3 g of tritium to the machine. After DTE1, the tritium inventory in the torus remained a factor of about three higher than expected from the Preliminary Tritium Experiment in 1991, and this is thought to be related to tritium-saturated carbon films on surfaces which are shadowed from erosion by the plasma. During DTE1 records were set for peak (16.1 MW) and quasi steady-state (4 MW for 4 s) fusion power and for the ratio of fusion power to input power (0.62; if a similar plasma could be obtained in steady-state, the Q would be 0.94±0.17). Alpha particle heating was clearly demonstrated and shown to be consistent with classical expectations. In the optimized shear mode of operation internal transport barriers were established for the first time in D-T, with a threshold power roughly equal to that in D-D. ELMy H-mode studies in D-T have considerably strengthened the basis for predicting the heating requirements and performance of ITER. Candidate ICRF heating schemes for ITER were successfully tested and the relevant simulation codes validated. With regard to isotope effects in ELMy H-modes, the ITER scaling for the H-mode threshold power had to be modified to include an inverse mass dependence (≈A-1), while energy transport showed little dependence on isotope and seems to involve different physics in the edge and the core of the plasma. JET confinement data obtained under conditions which were identical to ITER in most dimensionless parameters scale close to gyro-Bohm and predict ignition for ITER provided the required densities can be reached.},

@article{Barabaschi2025,
   abstract = {The ITER Project has gone through a period of transition, with progress continuing despite challenges, and is moving forward on the basis of a new project baseline. Repairs to key components—the vacuum vessel sectors and thermal shields—are progressing according to schedule. Progress has continued on construction, manufacturing, assembly, and system commissioning. Following more than a year of review, a new baseline proposal was submitted to the ITER Council in June 2024, and is now serving as the working reference schedule. The discovery and analysis of geometric non-conformities in the bevel joints of several vacuum vessel sectors, as well as chloride corrosion cracking in the cooling pipes of the thermal shields, led to a slowdown in ITER tokamak assembly while repairs are carried out. In parallel, an assessment of root causes, including a thorough self-examination of project quality culture, was followed by a reorganization to prepare for the challenges ahead. Extensive discussions were held with the French nuclear safety authority (ASNR) to restore trust and evaluate strategies to enhance the safety demonstration accompanying ITER's licensing. Meanwhile, the power supply systems, the cryogenics plant, and several cooling water systems have completed installation and are largely commissioned. All poloidal and toroidal field coils have been delivered, as well as most of the central solenoid modules and many other major components. The largest task over the past year has been to channel all these elements into a realistic, feasible updated project baseline. In the resulting proposal, the previously envisioned stages of assembly and operation are largely consolidated. Technical and operational risks are mitigated by replacing beryllium with tungsten for the first wall panels and incorporating the divertor, shield blocks, a sacrificial first wall, and other risk-reducing components into a more complete machine before initial operations, as well as fully testing some toroidal and poloidal field coils before their installation. The start of research operations (SRO) in 2034 will inaugurate a 27-month period of substantial experimentation with hydrogen and deuterium plasmas, to culminate in operating the tokamak with pulses of several tens of seconds at full magnetic energy and plasma current (15MA) in 2036. The SRO phase will largely demonstrate the integration of systems needed for industrial-scale fusion operations. The start of deuterium-tritium operations phase will be delayed by 4 years from the previous baseline, from 2035 to 2039. Highlights from these areas (manufacturing, tokamak assembly, system commissioning), will be presented along with the updated baseline proposal and other aspects of project status.},

   abstract = {The tungsten programme in ASDEX Upgrade is pursued towards a full high-Z device. The spectroscopic diagnostic of W has been extended and refined and the cooling factor of W has been re-evaluated. The W coated surfaces now represent a fraction of 65% of all plasma facing components (24.8 m2). The only two major components that are not yet coated are the strikepoint region of the lower divertor as well as the limiters at the low field side. While extending the W surfaces, the W concentration and the discharge behaviour have changed gradually pointing to critical issues when operating with a W wall: anomalous transport in the plasma centre should not be too low, otherwise neoclassical accumulation can occur. One very successful remedy is the addition of central RF heating at the 20-30% level. Regimes with low ELM activity show increased impurity concentration over the whole plasma radius. These discharges can be cured by increasing the ELM frequency through pellet ELM pacemaking or by higher heating power. Moderate gas puffing also mitigates the impurity influx and penetration, however, at the expense of lower confinement. The erosion yield at the low field side guard limiter can be as high as 10-3 and fast particle losses from NBI were identified to contribute a significant part to the W sputtering. Discharges run in the upper W coated divertor do not show higher W concentrations than comparable discharges in the lower C based divertor. According to impurity transport calculations no strong high-Z accumulation is expected for the ITER standard scenario as long as the anomalous transport is at least as high as the neoclassical one. © 2005 IAEA, Vienna.},

The gas inlet and pumping systems have been recalibrated, reaching an accuracy of about 3%, which is mostly given by uncertainties of the gas temperature. Clear saturation of the wall is observed after the wall is loaded with 19 × 1021 at almost independent from details of the discharge program.

@article{Bachmann2016,
   abstract = {In the frame of the EUROfusion Consortium activities were launched in 2014 to develop a concept of a DEMO reactor including a large R&D program and the integrated design of the tokamak systems. The integration of the in-vessel components (IVCs) must accommodate numerous constraints imposed by their operating environment, the requirements for precise alignment, high performance, reliability, and remote maintainability. This makes the development of any feasible design a major challenge. Although DEMO is defined to be a one-of-a-kind device there needs to be in addition to the development of the IVC design solutions a remarkable emphasis on the optimization of these solutions already at the conceptual level. Their design has a significant impact on the machine layout, complexity, and performance. This paper identifies design and technology limitations of IVCs, their consequences on the integration principles, and introduces strategies currently considered in the DEMO tokamak design approach.},

@article{Schweer2009,
   abstract = {Long term tritium retention is one of the most critical issues for ITER and future fusion devices. While a global analysis of the T retention can be made by T accountancy in the activated phase of ITER, fuel retention and control must be already addressed in the non- activated phase, to identify the mechanism, location and amount of retention, its dependence on plasma and wall conditions and to qualify T retention mitigation and control techniques. For this purpose a new diagnostic, laser induced desorption spectroscopy of retained fuel has been developed and applied in TEXTOR. Hydrogen isotopes are desorbed from re-deposited layers on graphite plates by rapid heating with laser radiation. The released particles have been quantified in situ by spectroscopic measurements of hydrogen lines in a tokamak plasma. The results were validated by ex situ analysis of the hydrogen content of deposited a-C:H layers. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The technique based on quadrupole mass spectrometry of the material ejected by laser-induced ablation – LIA-QMS is proposed as a tool to measure H/D/T content in carbon co-deposits in the first wall and divertor regions of tokamak reactors. Tungsten tiles exposed in Globus-M2 tokamak were taken for validation experiments. Measurement accuracy was determined by comparison with the results obtained by laser-induced desorption – LID-QMS and conventional thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). Total amount of deuterium in hydrocarbon deposits was found to be 2.8 × 1017 D/cm2, when measured by – LIA-QMS, 3.0 × 1017 D/cm2 for LID-QMS and 2.9 × 1017 D/cm2 for TDS. The main uncertainty of D surface concentration are caused by inhomogeneity of the deposit thickness over the sample area or by presence of hydrocarbon species in the released gas.},

   abstract = {The paper reports the first demonstration of in situ laser-induced desorption — quadrupole mass spectrometry (LID-QMS) application on a large scale fusion device performed in summer 2023. LID-QMS allows direct measurements of the fuel inventory of plasma facing components without retrieving them from the fusion device. The diagnostic desorbs the retained gases by heating a 3 mm diameter spot on the wall using a 1 ms long laser pulse and detects them by QMS. Thus, it can measure the gas content at any wall position accessible to the laser. The successful LID-QMS application in laboratory scale and on medium size fusion devices has now been demonstrated on the larger scale and it is already foreseen as tritium monitor diagnostic in ITER. This in situ diagnostic gives direct access to retention physics on a short timescale instead of campaign-integrated measurements and can assess the space-resolvedefficacy of detritation methods. LID-QMS can be applied on many materials: on Be deposits like in JET, B deposits like in TEXTOR, C based materials or on bulk-W.},
